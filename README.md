# MokTech Industries - Fortify

MokTech Industries are proud to present to you a complete rework of the ACE Fortify framework, exclusively made for the Special Operations Brigade!
This is the standalone release of our heavily modified Fortify system. **This standalone does not require any other mods besides CBA and ACE.**
**Do not run this standalone mod and MokTech Industries - Core alongside. Core already contains Fortify!**

The Special Operations Brigade is a starsim unit dedicated to forming teams of highly-trained Republic Commandos, ARC Troopers, Shadow Troopers, Clone Assassins and Ace Pilots . If you are interested in learning more about us, feel free to visit our Discord server using the link below:

## Features
- Budget-based fortification construction using shared crates
- Many different specific presets, based on the crate(s) nearby
- Individual budgets using backpacks (for smaller fortifications)
- Saving built fortifications into compositions
- Later loading saved compositions that were saved previously
- Spawning pre-defined compositions from crates
- Some modernizations/fixes for ACE Fortify
- Does not directly interact with ACE Fortify, both systems can be used alongside and independently
